Hi, my name is Ivan Guerra, I am an embedded software engineer.

I've worked in the aerospace industry for over 6 years specializing in avionics
software development. Over the years, I've developed various flight control
device drivers. Currently, I am working a project to improve the autonomous
capabilities of an aircraft.

This blog is about the different development projects I take on in my spare
time.
