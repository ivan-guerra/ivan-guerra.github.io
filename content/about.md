Hi, my name is Ivan Guerra, I am an embedded software engineer.

I've worked in the aerospace industry for over 6 years specializing in avionics
software development. Previously, I've developed engine control algorithms and
actuator/GPS/air data system drivers. Currently, I am working a project to
improve the autonomous capabilities of an aircraft.

This blog is about the different development projects I take on in my spare
time. Each article serves as a journal of what I created and learned.
