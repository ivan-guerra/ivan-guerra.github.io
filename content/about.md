Hello! Welcome to my website.

This blog began in 2022. The posts are all technology and programming-related.
This site serves as a personal archive of projects and topics future me may want
to reference.

Most if not all the code that's posted is available on [GitHub][4]. All projects
on my GitHub have liberal licenses, so feel free to take what you find useful.
