As a Linux developer, you have probably spent some time optimizing your
workflow. In the world of Linux, you're both blessed and cursed with many
choices. You have a choice of distro, shell, terminal emulator, desktop
environment, package manager, editor, the list goes on. It can get overwhelming
to upgrade tools let alone start from scratch.

This is the first in a series of articles that presents a modern Linux
development workflow. These articles aim to have something for both new and old
Linux developers. The series will start from scratch and will build up a dev
environment through example.

## What's Worth Optimizing

What kind of software has the biggest impact on the dev workflow? Rephrasing the
question, what pieces of software do you interact with the most? The list below
covers a number of heavy hitters in Linux desktop land:

- Linux Distribution
- Desktop Environment
- Terminal Emulator and Shell
- Text Editor

Each article in this series will cover one of the components. The articles will
discuss tradeoffs and present a number of options. You'll see the installation
and setup of one of those options. It's highly recommended that if you find
another option appealing, that you take the time to do research and opt for
what works best for you. Linux is about having choices. The goal of these
articles is more so to inspire thought than direct.

## What About Hardware

This series is software centric. That said, it's worth it to take a moment to
discuss hardware. When you think of hardware you may think of the CPU, RAM, GPU,
etc. You're not wrong. However, when discussing optimizing one's workflow, it's
equally important to analyze the keyboard, mouse, desk, monitor, etc. Those are
topics for another perhaps future series.

Here's what you need to know before reading ahead. **None of the software
presented in this series requires specialized PC hardware**. You don't need the
latest CPU from Intel. You don't need a GPU. You don't even need a PC built in
the last decade! The software presented is lightweight and portable. As long as
you got the basic IO devices (keyboard, mouse, and screen), a working
desktop/laptop, and an internet connection, you're ready to follow along.
