[programmador.com](https://www.programmador.com) is a site where I post about my developer projects and tech in general. programmador.com is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and gets its look and feel from the open source theme [hugo-ficurinia](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-ficurinia/).
